        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A sentimental one. Brings back memories of countless skipped classes
            in highschool with my friends during happy hours in one of the first
            american-style restaurants in Warsaw. This recipe is quite easy, but
            attention to detail is key (just as in coding).

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut wings in half to separate the drums from the wingettes. Pat
                the wings dry with a paper towel. Preheat the oven and line a
                rimmed baking sheet with foil
            </li>
            <li>Combine baking powder, salt, and garlic powder</li>
            <li>
                Place the chicken wings in a large mixing bowl and toss them in
                the dry seasoning until well-coated. Assemble the wings in a
                single layer over the rack
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the center of the oven for 50 minutes, flipping halfway
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, stir together melted butter, sugar, and hot
                sauce
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer chicken wings to a bowl, and toss, drizzle with sauce
                and toss to coat. Serve with your favorite sauce
